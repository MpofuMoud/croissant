          <strong>Method</strong> <br />First you need to sift the flour and mix
          with baking powder. Then add a dash of salt, sugar, yeast and mix
          well. Next, pour it into the milk and add the butter (softened) and
          water. Knead the dough, then cover it with cling film and leave until
          it increases about two times. Once the dough has risen, it is
          necessary to trample and hide it in the fridge for half an hour.
          Removes the dough from the refrigerator and spread on the table dusted
          with flour. In my mind we divide the dough into three parts, two of
          them grease with butter. Then turn the dough by first bends ungreased
          part of the test, and then oiled. You get, kind of book. Back hide our
          dough in the fridge for an hour (in order to keep the oil frozen).
          Remove the dough from the refrigerator and again we perform the
          previous operation and put the dough in the fridge for another half an
          hour. This procedure must be repeated three more times. When the dough
          is ready, roll out into a thin layer, then cut out a circle and divide
          into eight pieces. Every part turn into the shape of a croissant.
          Leave our croissants so they came over, and then grease them with egg
          yolk and place on a baking tray, pre-greased with sunflower oil. The
          Oven should be already heated to 220 degrees, but the oven kruassany
          should be at a temperature of 190 degrees until Golden brown. To Serve
          the croissants when they need to cool a bit. Bon appetit! Now you can
          not only treat yourself to real French croissants, but also to treat
          accidentally nagryanuvshaya guests by preparing a quick croissant from
          ready-made puff pastry.
